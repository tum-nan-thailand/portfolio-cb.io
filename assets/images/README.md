# Image Placeholders

This directory is for storing images used in your portfolio.

You should add the following images:
1. Your profile photo (recommended size: 400x400px) - replace profile-placeholder.jpg
2. Project screenshots or thumbnails (recommended size: 600x400px) - replace project-placeholder.jpg
3. Any other images you want to include in your portfolio

For now, you can use placeholder images from services like:
- https://placeholder.com/
- https://picsum.photos/
- https://placehold.co/

Example usage:
- Profile placeholder: https://placehold.co/400x400/4a6cf7/ffffff?text=Your+Photo
- Project placeholder: https://placehold.co/600x400/4a6cf7/ffffff?text=Project+Screenshot
